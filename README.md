## Description
This project serves as practice with the Ruby on Rails framework. This project simulates a mock website for a grocery store that displays a list of products and reviews for specific products. This application uses PostgreSQL DB to save reviews and product information, and also allows us to manipulate the data using scopes to filter and retrieve data in a specific way. For instance as users add new reviews they will be able to view the newest reviews on the landing page. Additionally, using validations in Rails, we can limit user entry and account for errors.

Epicodus Ruby on Rails Independent Project Week 1 || Rails Basics

### Specs
* Users will be able to add products
* Users will be able to edit and remove products
* Users will be able to filter using scope
* Users will be able to view details of specific members


## Description
This project serves as practice with the Angular 2 Framework, more specifically: use of a router to navigate between pages, filtering data with pipes, using a service to share data between multiple components, CRUD functionality, and implementation of components. This web application will allow users to manage a club. In this case, I chose to manage a fictional club called Epicodus FC. Users will be able to add members to the club, edit their details, remove members from the club, and filter members by experience. This application is connected to Firebase so all entries will be saved through the cloud database.

application up and running.
